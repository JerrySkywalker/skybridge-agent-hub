# Progress Log

## 2026-05-21

- Read the repository instructions, architecture docs and staged goals.
- Implemented a typed `skybridge.agent_event.v1` schema with validation and tests.
- Built the server MVP with health, event ingestion, event listing, run summaries, SSE stream, notification endpoints and local JSON persistence.
- Added ntfy provider behavior with safe placeholder recording when credentials are missing.
- Added Codex hook normalization and guard-hook redaction/safety updates.
- Added local sidecar event forwarding.
- Implemented React widgets, dashboard shell and a framework-neutral status Web Component.
- Updated development, hook and architecture docs for local operation.
- Validation: `corepack pnpm check` passed; Docker dev/test compose config passed; local server smoke test passed for health, event ingest, event list and run summaries.
- Environment note: `pnpm` and `just` are not directly on PATH here. Commands work through `corepack pnpm`; `just check` could not be run because `just` is not installed.
- Replaced MVP JSON-first persistence with SQLite-backed server persistence at `.data/skybridge.sqlite`; existing `.data/skybridge-store.json` or `SKYBRIDGE_DATA_FILE` data is imported once and left untouched.
- Added focused hardening tests for SQLite persistence/restart behavior, JSON migration, notification trigger placeholder recording, SSE replay, Codex hook parsing/redaction, and React widget static rendering.
